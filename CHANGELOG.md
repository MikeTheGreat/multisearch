## [Unreleased]

-   Saving the current preset into a persistent, unnamed, between-vscode-sessions storage mechanism so that any acquired search slots will pick up next time
-   Save the current preset into a named entry in the JSON presets file

## [2.0.0] - 2020-08-26

Changed a bunch of things in the user-visible configuration so I'm bumping the version up to '2' in accordance with semantic versioning.

## [1.0.10] - 2020-08-26

Solid release for V1.
